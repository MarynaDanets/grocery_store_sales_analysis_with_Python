# Grocery Store Sales Data Analysis Project

This data analysis project, completed as part of my **"Python for Data Analysis"** coursework, showcases my individual effort and application of data analysis techniques to real-world business data. The project focuses on analyzing grocery store sales data from chain stores across four Asian countries.

## Key Features:

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Comprehensive exploration of grocery store sales data to uncover key trends and patterns.
- **Data Manipulation with Pandas:** Efficient handling of data tasks, including filtering, grouping, summarizing, and cleaning, using the powerful Pandas library.
- **Data Visualization:** Utilization of Matplotlib and Seaborn to create informative visualizations that highlight important sales trends and customer behavior.
- **Insights & Conclusions:** In-depth analysis leading to actionable insights, including an understanding of customer lifetime value, sales performance, and demographic trends.
- **Tableau Reporting:** Creation of an interactive report in Tableau, offering a visual summary of the key findings. [Link](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/maryna.danets/viz/ProfitMargin_17212539303290/ProfitMargin) to view more on Tableau Public.

## Project Description:

This project delves into the sales data of grocery chain stores across four Asian countries. Through meticulous data processing, I analyzed various aspects of the sales data to understand customer behavior, sales dynamics, and product performance. Key areas of focus include:

- **Sales Trends Analysis:** Investigation of sales patterns across different countries and cities, identifying high-performing regions and potential areas for growth.
- **Customer Behavior Insights:** Analysis of average transaction values, customer demographics, and lifetime value to better understand customer purchasing habits.
- **Profitability & Payment Methods:** Examination of the profitability of different product categories and the payment methods used, providing insights for optimizing sales strategies.
- **Statistical Testing:** Application of statistical methods to validate findings and support data-driven decision-making.

The project concludes with actionable recommendations for business improvements, aimed at enhancing profitability and customer satisfaction.
